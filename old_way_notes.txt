# ran a starburst99 model off web and called it normal
# it gave me a normal.spectrum1 file containing uv spectra

#to get the last time 1e8 years
tail -n 1220 normal.spectrum1 >  spectrum_1e8.dat
# has 1220 lines!

# columns in this file are
# time, lambda(AA), stellar+neb flux , stellar flux, neb flux
# we want column 2 and 3
# The Starburst99 spectrum is in units of ergs/s/A. 

# use junk.awk to get a file with only col 2 and 3 in them
awk -f junk.awk spectrum_1e8.dat > convert.inp


# arguements z dlum npts
# Dlum is in Mpc and you get it using the cosmology calculator
# convert so flux in ergs/c/A/cm2
convert3.out 0.1 10.0 1220 convert.inp > spec_a11.dat

# run the above for each galaxy separately
# but with correct redshifts and dlums

#in pyraf
stsdas.hst_calib.synphot
calcphot "band(acs,sbc,f140lp)" spec=spec_a11.dat form=counts
# this works and outputs counts/s
